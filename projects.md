    <h2>Leveraging Natural Language Processing for Public Health Screening of COVID-19</h2>
    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has attracted a lot of public interest, with people sharing their experiences of symptoms and recovery from this virus on social media
platforms such as YouTube. This offers an opportunity to contribute to present
and future public health screening efforts aimed to fight pandemics. Leveraging COVID-19-related data on YouTube, an automatic system could be created
using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) tools to analyze speech and match
symptoms with those in this data to determine if an individual has COVID-19.
This approach could potentially detect COVID-19 at an early stage, enabling
prompt public health response to stop the spread of this virus. Overall, content
analysis of COVID-19-related vlogs on YouTube and ASR tools could prove to
be a productive means of enhancing public health surveillance efforts during the
COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

    <h2>Sentiment and Word Cloud Analysis of FIFA World Cup 2022 Tweets</h2>
    <p>The study analyzed 22,524 English tweets with the hashtag WorldCup2022 to investigate the sentiments expressed on Twitter during the event. The researchers used Natural Language Processing techniques, including VADER sentiment and Word Clouds, to determine positive and negative sentiments. The findings showed that while sports events tend to evoke positive emotions, negative sentiments were also prevalent, particularly regarding human and migrant rights in the host nation. The research concluded that Natural Language Processing is an efficient approach for detecting public emotions from textual data, and social media platforms can be a valuable source of data for understanding public sentiment.</p>

    <h2>Sentiment Classification of Russia vs Ukraine Tweets</h2>
    <p>In this project, I utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze tweets about the Russia-Ukraine conflict. I performed sentiment analysis to classify emotions as positive, negative, or neutral. Using Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), I identified significant keywords, and applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling to uncover underlying themes in the tweets. This analysis provided insights into public sentiment and the main topics discussed in relation to the conflict.

    <h2>Implementing Homomorphic Encryption on Datasets</h2>
    <p>In this project, I explored the use of homomorphic encryption to securely perform computations on encrypted data without decryption. I utilized PYFHEL and Concrete-Numpy libraries to encrypt small datasets and execute numpy operations on the encrypted data. The study focused on evaluating the feasibility and performance of applying machine learning algorithms on homomorphically encrypted data compared to unencrypted datasets. Despite the added complexity and increased processing requirements, PYFHEL facilitated the implementation of fully homomorphic encryption, demonstrating its potential for secure data processing.</p>
